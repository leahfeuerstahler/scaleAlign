Description: This package provides utilities for rescaling dimensions of 
    between-items multidimensional Rasch family models so that dimensions scores
    can be compared directly. This package includes functions for implementing 
    delta-dimensional alignment (DDA) and logistic regression alignment (LRA) 
    on either dichotomous or polytomous data. This function also includes a 
    wrapper for models fit using the TAM package.
